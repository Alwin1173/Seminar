Object detection plays a pivotal role in numerous real-world applications, ranging from autonomous vehicles to medical imaging. In real-time scenarios, both the speed and accuracy of detection are critical. \textbf{You Only Look Once (YOLO)} has emerged as a powerful algorithm for object detection, renowned for its ability to deliver high-speed performance without compromising accuracy. 
% Introduces the topic of object detection and YOLO, highlighting the importance of speed and accuracy. 
% \textbf{} is used to make "You Only Look Once (YOLO)" bold in the final PDF.
